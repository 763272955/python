This loan would really change the way my finances are. I woudl like to see the payments I make actually pay off a loan, instead of paying just interest with such high APRs on my current credit cards. I currently have a plan set in motion to pay them off without a loan, but it would take over 5 years, and way more interest charges.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",debt_consolidation,Consolidation,641xx,MO,4.96,0.0,Dec-1995,3.0,6.0,0.0,10984.0,84.5%,9.0,f,0.0,0.0,18494.3499555,18458.78,13000.0,5494.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,Apr-2015,5992.22,May-2017,0.0,1.0,Individual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,Cash,N

My job is very stable as the financial services industry is in high demand of risk and compliance professionals in lieu of the numerous regulations imposed on the industry. And if needed, I always have the option of working full-time for the Army National Guard if for some reason my civilian job was no longer present. I will have no issues repaying this loan. After factoring in the monthly payment amount into my monthly budget, and I will have no issues meeting my monthly obligations.  Also, being a member of the U.S military, especially an officer, the Army will not allow any of my debts to go into a delinquency status. The military will garnish my wages and provide them to creditors until the debts are paid, which can be seen as a little extra security in terms of repayment.

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated.
